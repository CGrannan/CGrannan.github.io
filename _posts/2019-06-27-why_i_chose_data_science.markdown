Hello, and welcome to my blog!  This post will be about my background and what led me towards data science.

A decade ago, I graduated from the University of Virginia with a bachelor's degree in psychology.  I focused mostly on perceptual research during my studies, so I am well versed in scientific methods and statistics.  Due to external factors, I missed my opportunity to go to graduate school and instead started working at a restaurant.  Since then I have worked my way through various restaurants in downtown Philly; but this year I decided it is time for a change.  I started looking into changing careers into something more rewarding, both financially and intellectually.  I considered what I would enjoy and also what I would be good at.

Ultimately I decided that I would do well in computer programming.  As a lover of logic puzzles and games, figuring out how to reach a desired output with a very straight forward and logic driven ruleset seemed perfect for me.  However, programming is broad and daunting to an outside observer with no training.  I was overwhelmed with questions.  What language do I start with?  Will I need another 4 year degree?  Even if I successfully got started, where would it ultimately take me?  What if I can't get a job after investing so much time and money into this?  While investigating the various ways to get into programming and what I could do with it, I discovered data science.  Creating code to instantly pour over volumes of data to perform statistical analysis and answer analytical questions intriqued me.  Data science combines the logic that I enjoy learning with the statistics and scientific reasoning that I developed in my psychological research.  A career in data science seems like a way to constantly learn and grow, while staying grounded in principles that I know and understand.  This was definitely the field that I was looking for!

Now that I figured out what I wanted to do, all I had to do was find a program to help me.  I decided on Flatiron because they offered answers to many of my questions above. I am eager to see where I go from here, and excited to share it with you!  Thanks for reading!
